# React Redux Ordering app
## Used Stack
- React library for app composability
- Redux for state management


## Additional useful libraries:
Bundler: <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a><br>
Testing: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a>

## Main features:


## Assumptions:
- When displaying an item from an order, I calculate the value of the line instead of reading the total. Since I have to use this logic when adding an new item to an order (no total provided), I thought it would make more sense to apply same logic on both sides.

## How to use it:
- Run the command `git clone https://github.com/GeniaT/ordering.git`,
- run `npm install`.
- Once done, run the command `npm run dev-server` to see the app running locally on your computer.
